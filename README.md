## Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs, or prompts, to guide generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to produce desired outputs. 
It involves crafting prompts that provide context, instructions, and examples to help the model understand the intent behind the query.

Prompt engineering can help models: Respond to a wide range of queries, Learn from diverse input data, Adapt to minimize biases and confusion, and Produce more accurate responses. 
Some common approaches to prompt engineering include: N-shot prompting, Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, Generated knowledge prompting, and Complexity-based prompting. 
Prompt engineers use creativity and trial and error to create input texts. They also prime the output by including a few words or phrases at the end of the prompt to obtain a model response that follows the desired form.
